                            <h4>BMI Calculator</h4>
                            <div class="paragraph">This project is a custom-made BMI Calculator, meant to calculate the BMI of some user based on their given height (in feet and inches) and weight (in pounds). Upon a person filling in all of the information on the form and pressing the "Calculate BMI" button, their BMI will appear under. A "Reset" button allows the information in the boxes to be reset. This project introduced the fundamentals of Javascript, like variables, functions and basic methods, and applying that with prior konwledge of web forms to make something.</div>

                            <div class="paragraph">This project is a model for an information page for a summer party called "Tulsa's Summe Party", which will take place on the fourth of July. The page features a countdown for the amount of time until the party's presumably most awaited event: the fireworks. This project focused mostly on new time-related Javascript objects and methods, like date and time objects, and timed commands in order to make a command run over and over for the passing of some amount of time.</div>

A table on the right shows the dates and times forupcoming events, with their respective event names and prices of admission. In this project, Javascript techniques, like loops and conditional statements, were employed to construct the table using HTML and filling in information based on array values, rather than editing the original HTML document.</div>

                            "Trophy Case Sports". The products of a customer's checkout cart, along with their corresponding prices, quantities and information, are organized into a table. The subtotal is calculated and shown at the bottom. Like the previous Lyman Hall Theater page, Javascript loops, conditional statements, and arrays were used to construct the table on the page, instead of directly editing the original HTML document.</div>

The now annotated online copy features a box of keywords that can be identified throughout the text with a yellow highlight. Clicking the keywords in the box utilizes hyper-reference links and element IDs to take you to the location of that keyword in the text. This project focused on the concept of nodes, using methods to append objects to one another and stringing them together.</div>
