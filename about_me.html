                My name is Ian Kwuan. I am 16 years old and I am a junior at Design Tech High School. 
                I am also a concurrent enrollment student of the community colleges of the SMCCD.
            </p>

                As someone aspiring to have a career in Engineering, my academic interests lie in math and physics.

                I didn't have much knowledge of Computer Science or programming languages prior to this semester.
                I decided to enroll in CIS 111 for Spring 2020 in order to address this lack of knowledge, and I can say I've
                learned quite a bit thanks to this class. This is a skill I definitely believe I can use again in the future.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy swimming and biking.
            </p>

                This portfolio is meant to showcase what I have learned through the several projects I have completed for this class. Please feel free to explore my projects and download them for yourself to check out.
